Commodore Telnet BBS Server
          
A simple Windows program that acts as a 'bridge' between serial and TCP/IP, allowing you to set up a Commodore BBS that can be Telnetted to (really just a raw TCP connection).   Also allows a C64 to "dial out" over Telnet.  Yeah, yeah, it's Visual Basic 6.

A list of Telnetable BBSes can be found here.

My own BBS is still up and running, telnet to bbs.jammingsignal.com port 23 .
